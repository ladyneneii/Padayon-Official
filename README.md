This is the third and final repository of our App Dev project "Padayon;" 

The first repository https://github.com/ladyneneii/CS3105-02-Interactive-Website contains only the client side of the app. 
The second repository https://github.com/ladyneneii/Padayon contains both the server and client sides of the app, but because of submodule problems, a third repository had to be created. 

To run the project:

1. Open a terminal window:

```
git clone https://github.com/ladyneneii/Padayon-Official 
cd client 
npm install vite --save-dev 
npm run dev
```

2. Open another terminal window:

```
cd server
npm run start
```

3. Import the sql files in the sql folder.
